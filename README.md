# Pandora's Box

### Summary
Pandora's Box is a mobile app and Internet of Things project designed to streamline and gamify interactions with parents and children on the subject of chores or tasks. It sets up a system where there  is a tangible reward controlled by the mobile application. 

Parents create tasks remotely and approve them but the kids ultimately get the satisfaction of remotely opening the box to get their reward.
